introduction: |
  The concept of brainstorming was established by advertising executive Alex Osborn, who began to devise methods for solving creative problems in 1939. The idea involves storming a creative problem “…and doing so in commando fashion, with each stormer attacking the same objective.”
  
  The aggression of such a quote seems so fitting – there’s something empowering about the term, as well as the process. But in order to brainstorm successfully, we need to enter the creative mindset. This can be difficult, especially since it is human nature to suppress our own ideas (as well as the ideas of others) out of a lack of creative confidence. So, how exactly do we create a space in which people are comfortable to let their creativity roam free, and how do we brainstorm successfully?

Beginning the brainstorming process on the same level will go a long way towards eradicating any anxiety people have about being judged by their superiors or subordinates. Which brings us neatly onto our next point…'

Even if someone dreams up a solution which will never come to fruition, try running with it and see what offshoots develop. Brainstorming is the exploratory phase after all – what have you got to lose?'

          It sounds counter-intuitive, but there’s a reason our best ideas come to us when we’re at our most relaxed (think shower time, lying in bed, and so on). The trick to brainstorming well is not concentrating too hard on the end goal. Think stray thoughts and random memories – your brain might just carry you towards a plausible solution.
