introduction: |
  We believe that a little reward goes a long way.
  
  BAE Systems approached us to produce material to go along with their ‘Employee Benefits Scheme’ – a mutually beneficial perk BAE Systems employees can use to get discounts on a wide variety of things on the high street; from holidays to high definition TV’s.
  
  The mailer we produced has gone out to 34,000 addresses around the world, designed to encourage more employees and their families to sign up to the scheme. We wanted the design to resemble a gift, to be unique amongst all the other bits and bobs in the mail and we’re extremely happy with the results.
