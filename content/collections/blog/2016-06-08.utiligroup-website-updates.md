introduction: |
  After our initial roll out of Utiligroup’s brand new website we we’re approached by the company for the development of the second phase of their online presence.
  
  We we’re excited by the possibilities Utiligroup had afforded the project and some of the ideas thrown around by both client and ourselves really pushed the boundaries. Creating impact and adding a new element to the site – we implemented videos to the homepage and as headers on several pages. This new element would become a stable part of the site as it reflected the dynamic and futuristic feel the company are embodying.
  
  We are both delighted with the results and are happy to see this kind of refresh take shape.
