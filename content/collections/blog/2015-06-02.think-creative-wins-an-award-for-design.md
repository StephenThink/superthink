introduction: |
  We’re very proud to announce that we were recently nominated for an award for our design work for BAE Systems, in the BAE Systems Commercial Achievement Award Scheme 2015. We have now received the letter to say that we have won and shall be attending an awards evening in London with the rest of the successful Commercial members this summer.
  
  It’s always nice to win awards but when your clients put you forward for them it’s that little bit more special. It informs us that what we’re creating is effective and well received by the audience, meaning happy clients, and we like happy clients.
  
  Thanks very much to the team at BAE Systems for the nomination.
