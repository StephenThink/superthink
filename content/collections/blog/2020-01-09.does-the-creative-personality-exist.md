          **Naturally motivated** 
          Visualising targets and goals can be easier for those with high levels of imagination. Creatives tend to be more aspirational than others, wanting to always create, design and craft something better than before, improving on their own work and styles. 
          
          **Open to experience**
          A diverse social network leads to deeper knowledge of others enabling the ability to understand different viewpoints. The willing to change your mind or admit you are wrong can make you more adaptable and flexible to new ideas. 
          
          **Perseverance** 
          Exhibiting the ability to see things differently, looking from another perspective to form unusual and clever solutions to resolve problems. Overcoming challenges with creative thinking only improves problem solving skills and creativity.  Thomas Edison, the great inventor, once said “I have not failed, I have just found 10,000 ways that won’t work”.
          
          **Positive**
          Happiness and motivation bring out the highest levels of creative activity. Due to their openness, creative minds tend to live longer, and may even get more creative with age. One of the key contributors to longevity was how creative people react to stress, often seeing obstacles as something to be overcome rather than a barrier which can’t be breached.
          
          **Spontaneous**
          Divergent thinking or free-flow thinking can generate many different ideas and concepts in a short amount of time, this thought process has been linked to individuals with playfulness and spontaneous personalities. 
          
          **Eccentric**
          Creativity can be unlocked by those who possess unconventional thought processes, it’s what gives people the ability to make connections between ideas that are usually unrelated. Conformity kills creativity, those who disregard the rules and break conventions can tap into new areas as part of the creative process. Sticking to the tried and tested doesn’t throw out new and original ideas.
          
          **Impulsive**
          Being unpredictable or instinctive isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it shows emotion, passion and, best of all, intuitiveness. 
          
          **Escapism**
          Creatives are dreamers. To be able to immerse themselves in their own imaginations allows people to think up solutions to issues that others simply can’t.
          
          **Objectivity** 
          It’s one thing to be fixated by your own creative ideas, but to judge them dispassionately is another thing altogether. A creative mind is always looking to find flaws in, accept constructive criticism of, and ultimately improve the solutions they have dreamt up.
          
          **Light-heartedness**
          Being creative affords people the opportunity to stop taking things - including themselves - seriously. It’s hard to produce creative ideas when you’re not having fun. As advertising tycoon David Ogilvy once said: “The best ideas come as jokes. Make your thinking as funny as possible.”
