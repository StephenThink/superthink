introduction: |
  Back in 1972, the first ever email was sent by an American programmer named Ray Tomlinson. At the time, nobody predicted that email could ever grow to revolutionise the way we communicate on a daily basis. 
  
  Email has been around for so long that most of us have come to take it for granted. Sadly, Tomlinson passed away in 2016. His legacy, however, is sure to live on for decades to come, particularly in the field of branding and marketing. So join us, if you will, on a journey of digital discovery, as we explore the vital role that email marketing plays in building a successful brand...

          Email marketing involves sending branded communications to a particular group of recipients, usually in an effort to promote a range of products or services. It’s an incredibly versatile means of communication – content-wise, email marketing can include:
          
          - Company news and announcements
          - Offers and promotions
          - Surveys
          - Reminders
          - Press statements
          
          Email campaigns usually combine both text and visual content, and there’s huge scope to create something memorable and engaging. The overall aim of email marketing is to keep audiences updated and informed, as well as to encourage positive action on their part. It’s worth remembering at this point that ‘audience’ doesn’t just mean customers – email marketing can also target employees or stakeholders, for example.
          
          _“I see email being used, by and large, exactly the way I envisioned... Everybody uses it in different ways, but they use it in a way they find works for them.” – Ray Tomlinson_ 
          
          A number of experts believe that email marketing is more essential than ever before – it’s even seen as more effective than social media in acquiring new customers. There are approximately 3.8billion email users worldwide (compared to around 3.4billion social media users), [with a huge proportion of consumers](https://optinmonster.com/email-marketing-vs-social-media-performance-2016-2019-statistics/) preferring to receive promotional messages via the former medium.

          By now, you should be starting to realise the potential of email marketing. However, in case you’re still in doubt, here’s 8 killer reasons to put your trust in an email marketing campaign…
          
          **Keeping things on target**
          Email marketing allows your brand to target a specific demographic, meaning you’ll have full control over who sees what (think location-specific offers, as an example). Identifying what type of people are receiving your email campaigns will enable you to separate your recipients into groups and target people with more relevant content. Remember, increased relevance means increased value for your target audience, the by-product of which is greater brand loyalty.
          
          **Preaching to the converted**
          Don’t see this as a bad thing – in fact, it’s quite the opposite. People who sign up to receive your brand’s emails are already interested and therefore much more likely to entertain what it is you’re talking about. Whether your brand is e-commerce or not, email subscribers are much more likely to impulse buy (Brits are estimated to spend [more than £3bn](https://www.whistl.co.uk/news/brits-spend-over-3-billion-on-impulse-buys-every-month) monthly on impulse purchases alone), which is why you’ll often see the deployment of tactical marketing methods within email campaigns, such as exclusive offers and easily-visible links to specific products and services. 
          
          
          **A branded solution**
          Say it loud, say it proud: email marketing is the perfect way to extend your branding and create a memorable digital impact. An unforgettable email campaign is great for your brand’s identity (even a well written subject line will stick in a reader’s mind throughout their day). Credibility and consistency are two hallmarks of an unshakeable brand – establishing both via email marketing can set you on the road to success.
          
          **Shareability**
          The days of emails going viral are generally on the wane. However, the most important touchpoint in a piece of email software is still the ‘forward’ button. You should be looking to maximise shareability wherever possible – it’s free advertising, after all! An effective email campaign will be shared, shared and shared again, so get incorporating those social media buttons and including content that can be passed on to recipients’ friends and families (the obvious choice here would be some tempting promotional offers). The more people out there hitting the forward button, the more your subscriber and order numbers should start to hit new horizons. 
          
          **A measured approach** 
          Make no mistake, data is beautiful. Being able to measure the success of each campaign and tweak things going forward is just another reason to love email marketing. Once again, the end goal is increased relevance for the recipient (which, you guessed it, leads to increased custom). A data-driven campaign is a justifiable campaign – click-through stats, open rates, a spike in subscribers within a certain timeframe… each statistic offers insight into your audience’s habits, a goldmine of information which allows you to vindicate every success and learn from every failure.
          
          [Check out our previous blog post on the relationship between data and creativity](/thinking/data-creativity-a-match-made-in-heaven)
          
          **Right on time**
          Perhaps the most obvious benefit of email marketing (and email in general) is that it’s instant – but it doesn’t have to be. Using scheduling tools, we can automate the whole process. This not only lightens your workload, but it also enables you to create campaigns which target particular dates, times and occasions throughout the year. Great for Christmas promotions, for example, but double great for focusing on specific audience demographics. 
          
          To elaborate, cast your mind back to the previous point, which highlights the importance of using data to make informed decisions. If we can see from analytics tools that open rates for over 50s are highest around 9am on a Sunday morning, for instance, we can schedule the latest campaign to send at 8.45am on Sundays. Sure enough, our hot-off-the-press email will be sitting pretty at the top of inboxes, ready and waiting for when our audience logs on. It may seem insignificant, but it makes our brand that tiny bit more visible (not to mention reliable). Marginal gains play quite the role when it comes to branding strategy.  
          
          **Cost effectiveness**
          Email campaigns allow you to save on printing costs, delivery and advertising space. In fact, space is effectively unlimited. Whilst that’s not an excuse to write War and Peace, it affords you the flexibility to use the space in whichever way you wish and, when the need for detailed content calls for it, you can add what’s required without worrying about having to fork out for the extra design room. 
          
          **Wide reach**
          An increasing number of people are checking their emails on the go. In fact, around 3 in 5 consumers access their inbox when they’re out and about, with the figure rising year-upon-year (check out more interesting email usage statistics [here](https://www.emailmonday.com/mobile-email-usage-statistics/) ). We have the ability to reach people almost anywhere on the planet nowadays – what brand wouldn’t want to take advantage of that?

        header: 'What Considerations Do I Need to Make?'
        blog_content: |
          Now that we’ve outlined the benefits, it’s worth identifying some of the key factors that can be the difference between failure and success when it comes to email marketing. That’s right: before you start spamming every Tom, Dick and Harry on your brand’s subscriber list, there are some very important considerations to make...
          
          **Privacy**
          It’s almost two years since GDPR was introduced. In that time, there’s been a great deal of concern generated over data compliance and the protection of people’s personal details. Businesses are required to adhere closely to the rules or face huge financial punishments. Don’t let that put you off, though – [read our blog post on why GDPR is a good thing for everyone concerned](/thinking/gdpr-is-a-good-thing-for-everyone).
          
          **Relevance and value**
          Nobody likes being bombarded with content – your job is to figure out how your brand brings value to its audience and communicate that through your email marketing. Relevant, quality content is the way forward (we’ve also written a guide to content marketing which elaborates on this – [it can be found here](https://thinkcreative.uk.com/the-importance-of-content-marketing)
          
          **Creativity and aesthetics**
          It was only right that we saved the most important factor until last (we are creatives, after all...). A well-crafted email campaign will connect with people and make an impact, as well as show exactly what your brand is about. Creativity shouldn’t just be limited to content, either. Subject lines can make or break an email campaign, so copy must be imaginative and on-point.
          
          If you’re looking to present your brand in the best possible way, the design should be responsive, which means it will look just as good on desktop as it does on mobile devices. Equally important is the positioning of design elements such as calls to action – whether it’s sharing, paying a visit to your brand’s website or taking advantage of a promotional offer, prompting the recipient to engage further will encourage positive action and decrease the likelihood of your email being swept into the junk bin.
          
          **Conclusion**
          It’s not hard to see why email marketing and branding go so well together – an email is an incredibly efficient canvas on which to proudly display everything that’s excellent about your brand. Apply a little creativity to your email marketing campaigns and you’ll build stronger relationships with your target audience in no time. And that’s definitely not to be sniffed @.
