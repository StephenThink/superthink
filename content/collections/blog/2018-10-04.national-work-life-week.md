          A perfect work-life balance is something everyone desires, but it can often be a struggle to achieve – sometimes there just never seems to be enough hours in the day to get everything done. When the scales tip in the wrong direction, it can compromise our productivity, motivation and – most important of all – our health and happiness.
          
          The creative profession demands a lot from the individual. Working to tight deadlines, communicating with clients and creating bold, original designs can occasionally put the work-life balance under threat.
