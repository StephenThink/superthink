          Pantone, which established its revolutionary universal colour-matching system back in 1963, continues to influence industry work with their annual award. The company considers lifestyle choices, destinations, the technological landscape and even the political climate, travelling all over the world in order to determine a colour which accurately reflects a multitude of global trends.
          
          Living Coral is described as light-hearted, optimistic and synonymous with “playful expression” whilst reflecting humanity’s increasing need for interaction and social connection. The colour is also said to be “evocative of how coral reefs provide shelter to a diverse kaleidoscope of colour.” The launch of Apple’s iPhone XR apparently influenced the award, too – the tech giant offers a coral colour option of its latest handset, which Pantone believes is symbolic of the fusion of cutting-edge technology and nature.
          
          It’s been almost 20 years since Pantone launched Colour of the Year. Living Coral’s predecessor, Ultra Violet, was chosen due to its mysterious and intriguing characteristics, with Pantone also feeling that the colour was reflective of Western pop culture (think Prince, David Bowie and Jimi Hendrix).
          
          Whether Pantone really can accurately condense the state of the world into a single colour is a matter of opinion – for every true believer, there is a sceptical cynic. Regardless, the company firmly believes that its Colour of the Year award can drastically influence choices in the year ahead. With that in mind, it will be interesting to see how much Living Coral people decide to let into their lives – just keep it fashionable, please…
