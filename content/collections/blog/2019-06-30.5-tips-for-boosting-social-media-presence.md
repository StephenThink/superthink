          Knowing the specifics of your target market will directly influence what you’ll be talking about on social media. Understanding your customer base will help your brand find its voice and establish the right tone of address. You can then focus on posting relevant content and developing a meaningful relationship with potential customers.

        header: 'Create a schedule'
        blog_content: |
          It’s all about timing. If you want to maximise engagement with customers, you can target specific dates and times to post (perhaps when your audience will be most active on social media, for example), even setting up automated posting in order to save time. Scheduling brings with it both consistency and organisation.

        header: 'Be active'
        blog_content: |
          It’s all well and good having social media accounts set up, but if you don’t actually use them, you’re brand simply won’t look alive. Being active doesn’t mean taking a scattergun approach and posting content every fifteen minutes – remember, it’s all about relevance and meaningful content. Being active also means keeping your profile information and bio up to date (perhaps with a link to a specific area of your website), as well as engaging in regular conversation with customers (yes, even the negative ones).

        header: ' Get topical'
        blog_content: |
          Getting involved in trending topics and news stories will get your brand noticed. It shows personality and helps people to associate with your brand. Again, it’s important to remember to get involved only when relevant. Regularly checking hashtags will help you to decide when and where to contribute. Bear in mind that the end goal should always be to present your brand in a positive light.

        header: Analyse
        blog_content: |
          There’s an abundance of analytical tools available online to help you to track the performance of content posted on social media. Viewing the cold, hard figures will help you to realise your audience’s needs and wants. You’ll be able to see what worked and what didn’t, allowing you to make adjustments to your future social media behaviour. And don’t forget, analysis doesn’t just mean making use of online tools. Use your head – check out what your competitors and customers are saying.
