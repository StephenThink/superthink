  3D printing offers a way to differentiate, experiment and push our creative abilities further…
  
  To say that today’s blog topic falls under the category of ‘the future of design’ might be stretching it somewhat – here is a form of technology which has been around since the 1980s – but it does feel a bit wrong to lump 3D printing in with present day tech. Perhaps the reason for this categorisation comes down to the fact that increasing affordability and accessibility means that we have only very recently started to reap the rewards of this world-changing medium on a wider scale.

        blog_content: |
          Firstly, let’s try and define 3D printing and explain – without jargon – how the magic happens. Things aren’t a million miles away from the standard 2D printing process in that the user sends a digital file (albeit this time made using 3D software) to the printer. 3D printers differ in that they use a special type of ‘ink’ called filaments, which can be made up of just about anything (paper, metal, glass… you name it). The printer then goes through many cycles to create a layered, physical object.
          
          3D printing has revolutionised the way that items are made. We can print bespoke human body parts and even food nowadays (yes, seriously), and the ability to make just about whatever we want isn’t the only benefit.
          
          The accuracy offered by 3D printing is unparalleled – we can create intricate, precise designs on demand, and with little to no wastage. The whole process saves on both cost and time. What’s more, if by chance we’ve made a mistake as part of the design process, we needn’t go back to square one – we can simply make tweaks to the original file and go again. When it comes to product development, making use of 3D printing is a no-brainer.

          Three-dimensional content is where’s it’s at right now – we only need look towards another fast-growing medium, virtual reality, to see that ([check out our previous blog post to learn more about the benefits of VR](/thinking/future-of-design-vr)). The ace up 3D printing’s sleeve, however, is its ability to exist as a tangible design outcome – there’s nothing quite like the experience of engagement that comes with physical interaction.
          
          It’s worth mentioning that the world of visual arts has been making the most of the 3D universe for many a year. Museums and exhibitions are littered with the latest 3D-printed offerings, whilst when it comes to branding and marketing, increased commercial accessibility means brands are able to make more out of promotional materials. The likes of Nike and Nokia have already dipped their toes in the water, and why not? 3D printing provides an opportunity for brands to test the water through cost-effective experimentation, whether it be through packaging prototypes or niche promotional materials – 3D business cards, anyone?
