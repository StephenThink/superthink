        blog_content: 'Define your brand and its services, offers, qualities, and values. The easiest way to start to develop an idea is to think of your brand as a person or character. How would it look, dress, act or talk, what beliefs and values would they hold and how would you like to be perceived. Think about how you would like your clients and customers or investors to see you and how would you like your employees to behave in contributions to this.'

          Be consistent but don’t make the same mistake of repeating the same thing over and over. Stay true to your brands tone of voice with copywriting, visuals whether it be friendly, informative, professional, service-orientated, promotional or conversational. Ensure all material, no matter its purpose, fits together to create the overall picture you have in mind and say’s the right thing.
