introduction: |
  The term ‘out of the box thinking’ originated from a solution to a puzzle where the goal is to join all nine dots with four straight lines without lifting your pen from the paper. The solution is to extend lines outside of this invisible perimeter, set by the arrangement of dots. Leading to the phrase ‘think outside the box’ entering the English language around the middle part of the twentieth century used as an example of lateral thinking. The challenge of connecting the dots requires unconventional thinking with a pinch of creativity, to approach it without seeing a boundary. Think you can solve it? Check out our social media accounts for the solution.
