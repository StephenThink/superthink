introduction: |
  You may remember in October our BAE Systems Rewards Mailer, after the campaigns success we were asked to produce extra material to send out rewarding their employees. This was in the form of recognition greeting cards rewarding selected BAE employees with a special bonus. The cards had to feel personalised to its employees, while complying with the strict brand guidelines and strong brand presence BAE Systems hold.
  
  Review from Client “The cards have just arrived and look AMAZING, thank you so much!!!”
  
  Star effort from the Think!Creative team once again.
