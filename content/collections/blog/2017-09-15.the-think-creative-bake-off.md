introduction: 'We are always looking for new ways to bring a little competition into the studio and we all love a treat with our brews so we thought we should have our cake and eat it too. With the new trailer for The Great British bake off being produced and released by Parabello studios, Blink Ink and Channel 4 we couldn’t resist baking up the idea of a Think!Creative team BakeOff in the run up to the new series starting.'

  description: 'No half baked ideas from our team but the proof was in the pudding and our Creative Designer Natalie came out on top with her M’n’M and almond pouring cake with salted caramel cake pops. The icing on the cake for us all was enjoying the great efforts each designer made every week for the team.'
