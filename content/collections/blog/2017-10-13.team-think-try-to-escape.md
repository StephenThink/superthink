introduction: |
  Recently we took a little trip into Blackpool’s town centre to the Escape rooms to put our team of designer’s problem solving and creative thinking skills to the test. We spilt into two teams to make it a little more competitive and fun, as it wouldn’t be a Team Think! night out without a little competition involved. The two themed challenges we opted for were the secret of the Tomb and the Egyptian experience, both equal in difficulty levels evening out the playing field for our two competing teams.
  
  The moment came when both teams were close to escaping their room and it came down to timing of who would win the victory, with just four seconds difference the Egyptians beat the tomb raiders. Overall it was a great evening and showed there’s no puzzling problems our team can’t solve when together, with the help of tapas waiting on the other side of course!
