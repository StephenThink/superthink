introduction: 'Seeing our creative projects come to life is a huge part of what drives us. We also love the multi-sensory experience that comes with tactile, 3D designs. So you can imagine our excitement when we received a knock on the door from the courier delivering a set of shiny new trophies, produced as part of our Safety Awards campaign for long-term client BAE Systems.'

          In our pursuit of something that would make a lasting impression and generate a buzz, we opted for a free-standing, layered design that would look perfect on the desk of a BAE Systems safety star. The award, to be presented to nominees who make a notable contribution to on-site safety, is made up from different levels of acrylic and printed graphics, which appear suspended inside the trophy. Each element of laminated acrylic is a nod to BAE Systemsâ€™ brand identity.
          
          The trophies are a culmination of several outcomes designed for the campaign, which you can learn about by viewing the full project in our portfolio.
