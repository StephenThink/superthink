introduction: 'As Halloween approaches a supernatural sense will sweep the country but creatives are spooked by a different set of fears. From server horror stories, fear of the 404 and nightmares of terrifying type, there is one that every designer dreads the most and has aptly become known as ‘the spinning wheel of death’. Here at Think!Creative we like to face our fears, there’s not a lot that scares our team! Maybe just the thought of finding there’s no teabags left for a brew.'
