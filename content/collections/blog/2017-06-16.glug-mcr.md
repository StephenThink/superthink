          Here at Think!Creative we like to involve our team in industry led events to keep updated on what’s going on in the design world and network with other creatives. This was our second time at a Glug Manchester Event, attending our first only a couple of months back in February.
          
          The evening was held in Manchester’s creative hub The Northern Quarter. It was a brilliant evening with some interesting talks by graphic designers, illustrators, freelancers and creative directors from the North West. Our highlight of the evening, aside from the free beer and pizza, was a talk given by Noir Agency co-founder, on the future of technology and use within branding. Our team was left with food for thought and we spent the next day discussing the evening in the studio.
