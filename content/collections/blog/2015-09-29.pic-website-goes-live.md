introduction: |
  We’re very happy to announce that the website for one of our newest clients, PIC, has gone live and our working relationship with them continues to grow.
  
  When they came to us, first and foremost they needed an online presence to build their brand and give potential investors a point of contact that’s easy to find. The website has been designed to reference the brand throughout and also works seamlessly across all devices giving the user an effortless experience in finding what they want. The easier your website is to use, the longer the audience will stay and the better chance there is that their visit converts to business.
  
  We’re happy to say the team at PIC love it – check it out [here](http://pic-property.com/).
