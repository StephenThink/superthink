introduction: |
  Well done you on securing a new project, now where to start when it comes to drawing up a brief and why it’s important to have one. Having a written document outlining all aspects of the project will eliminate any uncertainty of deliverables and expectations of the project and outcome for both parties when entering into an agreement. It can also be useful to review the projects progression since the initial agreement and if the project has evolved into something different than to what was first put forward.
  
  Here at Think! we know a thing or two about briefs so to help we have put together a short guide (Let’s keep it brief).

Getting to know your clients needs over their wants will get the results the client can measure and enable a successful outcome, potentially achieving a retainable relationship for the future.'

Find out what it is they want to achieve considering their future plan and what may be needed in any future briefs and projects. By asking questions you will learn more about the client so you can define what they need and expect from you and the work you are creating. Be open to the client asking questions of you too, be prepared to answer with the correct capability.'

The client will likely return in the future based on trust and build a relationship through these extras you offer. A case of reading through everything outlined and then reading between the lines give the potential to offer more understanding.'

          Outline the key deliverables and detail a schedule of deadline dates and reviews with timescales for budget planning and costs of the project. Having this in writing will keep both you and the client in good communication throughout with an agreed upon plan including of expectations to be met by both parties.
