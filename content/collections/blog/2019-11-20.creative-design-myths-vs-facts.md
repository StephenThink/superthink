        header: 'A logo is a brand'
        blog_content: 'A logo may be the first point of contact for an audience, but it certainly does not constitute a brand by itself. Of course, it is there to represent the values and message of your brand, but there’s no substitute for a full, consistent brand identity. Given time, when a strong brand identity is built, a logo may come to be recognised by audiences as a representation of your brand’s values.'

        header: 'Design is the same as art'
        blog_content: 'When it comes to both function and purpose, art and design differ massively. Design is not just about looking good – it’s about establishing a perfect blend of function and form. One of design’s most important aspects is its ability to communicate effectively, going beyond the visuals in order to deliver a message in the best way possible.'

        blog_content: 'Dismiss the importance of design at your peril! In a world in which people consume more visual content than ever, design is infinitely important. Good design creates a memorable impression and has impact. It unites, persuades and reaches out to people. Creative design is imperative in terms of communication.'

        header: 'Design is solely a computer-based process'
        blog_content: |
          We’d be lying if we said computers didn’t play a huge role in modern creative design – but one of the most important things to remember about design is that it is a process. Ask a professional designer how their process works, and you can bet that it doesn’t begin with a computer. Designers must firstly establish a strong brief (which summarises the client’s requirements), before researching and forming ideas – maybe through sketches or storyboards, for example. More often than not, these processes take place away from the screen. The actual design part – the “making” – whilst often done on a computer, requires a professional to understand the fundamentals of design long before a keyboard and mouse are touched.

        header: 'Design is a one-way street – from designer to client'
        blog_content: |
          Creative design is without doubt a two-way street, and clients play as instrumental a role as the designer – that’s what makes the process so exciting. Good designers will ask the right questions, whilst clients will supply as much information as they can. Of course, not all clients are sure of which direction to take, which doesn’t have to be a bad thing. Open communication can help establish the perfect vision required to move forward and create something amazing.
