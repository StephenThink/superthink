          The black-tie event was held in the beautiful Marine Hall in Fleetwood. As you can tell from the images above the hall looked stunning.
          
          Councillor Peter Murphy, Cabinet member with responsibility for Economic Development at Wyre Council, said: “We recognise that we have a lot of fantastic businesses in Wyre and the Wyre Business Awards evening is our way of celebrating the successes of our local businesses. I am delighted that we have hosted this event for the fourth year running and that the Business Awards involve more businesses every year in terms of both nominations and event attendees. For a small borough we really do punch above our weight for investment and business success. Wyre really is a great place to live, work, visit and invest.”
