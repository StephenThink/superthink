          Since 2000 Pantone has chosen a colour to reflect what’s happening in our world and has influenced and inspired trends in all aspects of design from fashion, interior design and innovation to architecture and graphic design.
          
          Unlike 2013’s colour Emerald which represented luxury, desire, elegance and beauty. Greenery embodies the sense of growth with notions of creating sustainable resources and environmentally friendly choices with hope of new beginnings. The idea of reconnecting to our environment with a fresh feeling embodied within attitudes from the last year, which saw the rise of organic and green superfoods such as avocado, kale and vegan lifestyle choices.
          
          Could this year’s colour choice see us all following in the expression of healthy resolutions and connecting with nature?
