          Our leading champion Nibby was left to defend his title through Bowling, the rivalry between our team became un-bowl-ievable in the weeks leading up to the night, with our newest creative thinker Natalie joining in on the action.
          
          The real boss came out on top winning 2/3 games, leaving Nibby one last chance to regain a win but the game was close and he was left beaten by our newcomer by only one point.
          
          Better luck in the next challenge.
