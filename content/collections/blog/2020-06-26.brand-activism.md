introduction: |
  It’s forever being stressed that immersive, personalised experiences are the next big thing in branding. But there’s also another huge factor at play, something which is heavily influencing the choices that audiences make: brand activism.
  
  Brand activism is all about pledging to promote or raise awareness of a worthy cause. Notable recent examples include Airbnb offering housing to refugees, and Stella Artois raising awareness of the water crisis by providing clean water to families in underprivileged countries. The Body Shop is another organisation which has long been committed prioritising causes that it holds dear (most notably animal testing). The modern brand is expected to lead by moral example, and an increasing number of organisations are doing so by pledging their support towards specific social, political, environmental and economic ideals. But why exactly do brands get involved in activism, and what risks do they run in the process?

        text: 'There are a number of benefits that come with incorporating activism into branding. First and foremost, it strengthens the relationship between customer and brand. The 2017 Edelman brand study suggested that 65% of audiences will choose a brand based on their beliefs. Audiences are clearly happy to back brands that support causes they too believe in.'

        text: 'Being perceived as forward thinking and progressive is invaluable in modern marketing. Branding activism promotes credibility, trust and accountability – in an age in which brands are fighting to show the world that they possess all three, aligning with a good cause could drastically improve the image of an organisation.'
