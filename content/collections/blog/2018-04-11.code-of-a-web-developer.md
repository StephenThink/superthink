        blog_content: 'Before you even think about looking at the designs you need to know where is the website going to be hosted? What hosting package is the website going to be with? It is important to familiarise yourself with the environment as all hosting packages are different. Does it use Cpanel or Plesk? Is it a dedicated server, VM, or shared service? What are the limits of hosting package in terms of bandwidth, CPU and RAM? These could determine functions and layouts.'

This ensures that everyone is on the same page when regarding functions and page layouts. Even when this is the case it is also important to spend time with the signed off designs. Take in all the small details of the page layout, text sizes, button sizes, margins, and paddings.'

        blog_content: 'WordPress is a great all-rounder as platforms go but is it what is needed in this circumstance? Is a content management system really required? Could a different one best suit the website? Maybe Drupal or Joomla will work better. If it is an ecommerce site, there’s Magento or EKM that offer greater functionality for businesses wishing to trade online.'

It can also be used as a good way of showing the client how their website is progressing. Without proof that things are moving along clients can wonder how much progress is really being made. If working with themes, it is important to create child themes so any changes made do not get erased on updates.'

Going through the process knowing beforehand whether a function like an animation could be performed by a plugin, theme, or needs to be hand coded will help to prioritise what needs to be done and by when. Which will help create a workable timetable to keep to.'

Even with the designs open at all times sizes could be out. The designer will pick it up and it can be fixed before it can even get near the client. After all the client has signed the designs off for how their new site will look. Every detail needs to be perfect.'

          Taking the time to comprehensively test can be hugely time consuming but it is essential that all browsers (on windows and iOS), screen sizes, and devices are tested. This doesn’t mean just a quick test but all functions on every page needs to be tested and double checked before it can be released to the client and then rolled out on the company’s URL. Once the website is live and up another full round of testing is required files can become corrupted when transferring them over.
