introduction: 'Design is integral to shaping your brand, but do you have the right set of creative tools to benefit your business? Research from ‘[A Forrester Consulting thought Leadership Paper Commissioned by Adobe](https://offers.adobe.com/content/dam/offer-manager/en/na/marketing/SMB/Design_Led_Firms_Win_The_Business_Advantage.pdf?trackingid=Z2G1FZ5D&mv=email)’ shows how business’ who value design and integrate design process and tools into their core values hold an advantage over their competition with customer engagement and loyalty. In an evolving world of technology, customers are being exposed to new experiences and expect businesses to keep up with how they want, where they want and when they want to interact with them. Design focuses on crafting brand experiences as much as the visual identity of the brand.

          _“Design isn’t just about beauty; it’s about market relevance and meaningful results.”_ John Maeda
          
          Design led business’s that prioritise creativity are more likely to use tools and processes to innovate. 83% of design-led business’ already have tools in place to test ideas with customers and 78% have defined processes for coming up with new ideas. Figures from business that don’t prioritise design dropped by nearly 10% in the same category.  Design leaders know the importance of research and how deeply understanding the customer shapes strategy implementation to meet the rise in expectations from consumer engagement.
          
          Research from the paper lists its key findings in how creativity levels within the business can impact customer and retention. Creativity within the core of the company builds innovation and collaboration processes through a variety of roles which users embrace and benefit from over the long term. Businesses which are not design led in comparison fail to hit the mark struggling to engage customers and employees alike with outdated technology and marketing processes.
