introduction: |
  As we said in our National Read a Book Day blog post: words can be inspiring. Despite this, they are often left on the back-burner when it comes to design.
  
  _“All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.”_ – Ernest Hemingway
  
  But copywriting is as much a part of the design process as any other element – it must not be overlooked. Good copywriting is so much more than throwing words onto a page. You need to be able to explain your brand to your audience in a clear, engaging way. Using words creatively can be extremely valuable in terms of attracting people’s attention, something which applies to every single brand out there – without exception.
  
  Think about it this way: the goal of any company’s branding is universally simple: to convey a message or set of values, with the ultimate aim of attracting a specific audience. Every good piece of branding provides a voice to go alongside the visuals. And what do voices do best? They communicate. It’s important not to prioritise visuals over words, and vice versa – both elements influence each other. Good copy combines with good design to both establish and reinforce the message.
  
  All of the above leads us neatly into the following question: why hire a copywriter?

          If you’re having trouble expressing your concepts or brand message in an appropriate way, then why not pass those concepts on to someone who can?

          Spending too much time around a concept or set of ideas can be detrimental. The outsider’s perspective that a copywriter brings could be the key to kickstarting the idea that’s been stagnating in your head, adding a fresh layer of excitement to the message you want to deliver.
