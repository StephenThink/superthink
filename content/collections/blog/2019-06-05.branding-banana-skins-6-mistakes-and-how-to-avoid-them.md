        blog_content: 'To build a brilliant brand, you must be able to develop a lasting relationship with your target audience. Identifying who you appeal to takes time and research, and some brands fall short as a result of being too vague. Identifying your target demographic will help you to understand the way that your audience thinks, as well as their interests and expectations – only after this point can you develop a brand which they will relate to.'

        blog_content: |
          It can be hard to face the cold hard truth sometimes. But when a brand starts to look and feel tired, audiences will take notice and start to lose interest. Be aware that a minor logo refresh might not be the only order of the day, either – markets change and evolve constantly, making it easy for messaging, materials and even brand values to begin missing the mark. Being honest and self-reflective is the best solution to this problem – you should always be on the lookout for signs of an aging brand and, more importantly, not placing any concerns on the back-burner.
