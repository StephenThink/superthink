introduction: |
  A booklet produced for BAE Systems HR Masterclass arrived yesterday, and we’ve got to say we are extremely happy with the results.
  
  Weighing in at an impressive 272 pages, this ring bound booklet not only looks the part but is an extremely useful tool in educating employees in all aspects of HR. It’s sometimes easy to forget the power of print in todays digital climate, but projects like this remind us of the power that remains in the medium.
