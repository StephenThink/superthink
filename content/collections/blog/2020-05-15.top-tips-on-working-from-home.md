          Now more than ever, it’s important to create a working space and establish boundaries for home working. Create a work space separate to your relaxing living areas, so it’s easier to switch between work mode and family time. Stick to your hours; create a routine to make sure you’re getting enough sleep and exercise. A great way to do all of this is to tidy your workspace at the end of your day, then get outside for a walk. This will give you the time to switch off mentally and return back home into your same space, but in a different mindset.
