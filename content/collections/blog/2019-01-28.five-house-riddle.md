  _“Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by the ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.”_ – Einstein
  
  Wise words indeed from everyone’s favourite scientist. With the above in mind, dare you test your genius by attempting to solve our riddle? We’ve adapted a well-known brainteaser known as Einstein’s Riddle (the man himself is said to have invented it as a child) and applied it to the Think!Creative team.
  
  There are five different coloured houses in a row. In each house lives one of our team members, each with a different job role. The five owners drink a certain type of beverage, listen to a certain type of music and keep a certain pet. No owners have the same pet, listen to the same kind of music or drink the same beverage. Can you solve our riddle below by answering the question: “Who owns the fish?” using only these facts below?
  
  **The Illustrator lives in the red house.**
  **The Creative Designer keeps cats as pets.**
  **The Web Developer drinks beer.**
  **The green house is on the left of the white house.**
  **The green house’s owner drinks coffee.**
  **The person who listens to rap music keeps rabbits.**
  **The owner of the yellow house listens to 80’s music.**
  **The owner living in the centre house drinks milk.**
  **The Creative Director lives in the first house.**
  **The owner who listens to country music lives next to the one who keeps dogs.**
  **The owner who keeps birds lives next to the owner who listens to 80’s music.**
  **The owner who listens to rock music drinks tea.**
  **The Senior Designer listens to dance music.**
  **The Creative Director lives next to the blue house.**
  **The owner who listens to country music has a neighbour who drinks water.****
