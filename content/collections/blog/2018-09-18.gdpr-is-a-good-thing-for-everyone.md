  As of writing this, Europe’s new General Data Protection Regulation is now in full effect.
  
  The memes have already started! But does it mean the doom and gloom that has been predicted? We for one don’t think so. In fact, we think it can only mean good things for both users and companies of all kinds.
  
  The old UK rules on data protection (Data Protection Act) were created in 1998, making them ridiculously out of touch with how technology has moved on and how data is used since then.

          GDPR gives users the right to choose if they want their personal data to be stored by companies. It forces them to write clear and concise privacy policies, so they are easily understandable in an effort to stop users blindly clicking confirm and having a more informed choice on what data they want to be stored by anyone. Best of all, it allows users a clear and easy way of having that data removed from any company holding data on them. It also offers users the ability to obtain all data held about them – without cost.
          
          For companies, GDPR will show any data controllers the clear and safe way to handle any user data. The days of gathering as much data as possible are over – under the new laws, you should only take what you need. Failing to comply will result in hefty fines, so it is important to know the rules.
