  Are you taking a step in the right direction in discovering your creativity?
  
  Have you ever paced up and down a room on occasion to generate ideas, a study from Standford University may explain our behaviour. Researchers have discovered a significant difference in levels of creativity and inspiration in those who choose to walk in comparison to those who sit and ponder. ‘A person’s creative output increased by an average of 60% when walking’. They explained it was the act of walking itself that seem to boost the generation of creative thinking, rather than the environment or additional factors.
  
  Some influential innovators such as the late Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple was known for his walk-meetings. Mark Zuckerburg from Facebook has also been spotted holding his meetings on foot.
