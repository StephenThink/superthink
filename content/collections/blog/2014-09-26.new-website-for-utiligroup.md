introduction: |
  We’re very fortunate to have some amazing clients, and clients that we have worked with for a very long time. Utiligroup are one of those so when they decided they needed a new website they turned to us. We designed and built a website that was easy to navigate for the audience, engaging yet not too text heavy, and most importantly given the world we now live in, mobile friendly and responsive for any device.
  
  Happy clients… happy designers. You can check out the [Utiligroup website here](https://www.utiligroup.com/).
