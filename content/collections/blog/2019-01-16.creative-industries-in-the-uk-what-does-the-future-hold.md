introduction: |
  It’s all been a bit doom and gloom lately in the UK. However, as we settle into a new year, we thought we’d take a look ahead and bring a little sunshine into people’s lives. Unbeknownst to many, Britain is fast emerging as a world leader of creative industries – and it’s about to grow stronger still.
  
  Back in November, the government announced that creative industries made a landmark contribution to the economy in 2017, breaking the £100 billion barrier. Record-breaking figures were also recorded within the digital industry, which is now worth a staggering £130 billion to the UK. As a whole, the creative sector employs around 2 million people and, according to the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport, has grown at almost twice the rate of the economy since 2010. In short, the creative sector is vital to the UK economy.

          The UK creative sector is made up of a broad range of disciplines:
          - Design
          - Advertising and marketing
          - Art
          - Crafts
          - Fashion
          - Music, performing and visual arts
          - Film, television and radio
          - Publishing
          - Museums, galleries and libraries
          - IT, software and computer services
          - Architecture
          In March of this year, the government announced that it had teamed up with the Creative Industries Council (a forum which includes leading figureheads from creative and digital industries) to announce a £150 million deal to provide further investment to the creative sector. The ambitious plan aims to consolidate the UK’s status as a ‘global creative powerhouse’, a move which promises exciting times for everyone involved, from those already in the industry to future generations, as well as consumers.
          
          The investment spans across several categories, including:

        blog_content: 'If the UK aims to fulfil its ambitions to be a world leader in creativity, it will require a growing pool of talent from which to draw. A far-reaching careers programme, which promises to run in at least 2000 schools nationwide, will aim to establish the next generation of young creatives.'

        blog_content: 'Through significant investment into breakthrough technology (such as augmented and virtual reality), the government aims to double the UK’s share of the market by 2025. The £33 million investment will lead to the creation of innovative, immersive content such as interactive art shows and tourism experiences. The money will also go towards cementing Britain’s position as leader of the European video game market. An additional £39 million investment will go towards establishing 8 creative research and development partnerships across the UK.'

        blog_content: 'Inspired by Hull’s 2017 stint as City of Culture, towns, cities and universities will be able to bid for a portion of the fund, which will be invested in creative and cultural growth. As City of Culture, Hull was boosted by the creation of almost 800 jobs, along with a local investment of £220 million, so it’s not hard to see why a wider-scale development plan has been targeted.'

        blog_content: |
          The film and television industry has grown by more than 100% in the last 5 years, with more than £2 billion invested per year (this figure is predicted to double by 2025). Demand for production space is increasingly rapidly, which has led to the expansion of film studios such as Pinewood and Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden.
          
          To be part of one of the world’s leading creative nations is exciting to say the least. Better still, it’s both reassuring and empowering to know that there are moves being made to ensure that the UK retains its position.
          
          Any closing thoughts are best summarised by Chief Executive of the Creative Industries Federation, John Kampfner: “Which other sector can do all of the following – help improve social mobility, help repair societal rifts, drive exports, grow the economy and define the UK internationally?” Hear, hear.
