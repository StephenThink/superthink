          Branding is one of the most vital elements of any organisation – many have failed in their pursuit of the recipe for success. Luckily, we think we know one or two things about cooking up a killer brand identity. Whilst there are many aspects to consider when plotting to build a strong, impactful brand, we’ve compiled a list of what we consider to be the top five key ingredients. Bon appétit.
          
          **Vision** – A brand vision will help you to establish both short and long-term targets. Remaining pinpointed on specific goals will provide purpose and focus, in turn influencing the message of your brand.
          
          **Values** – Set values and meet them. Specifically identifying what you stand for will not only go a long way towards establishing your identity, but will also give your brand integrity and emotion.
          
          **Audience Awareness** – An understanding of your brand’s target market will help you to establish the right tone of communication, whilst knowing your audiences needs will help you to understand how to position your brand. All audiences ultimately want is understanding and inclusion, so study your target demographic(s) carefully and pay close attention to their behaviour – successfully connect with them and they will believe in your brand.

          **Consistency** – Cohesion brings clarity – ensuring that brand choices are reflected right across the board will avoid confusion, promote unity and boost recognisability. The trick is to assess every action, every brand-related decision – no matter how big or small – and ensure that the message of your brand is not lost.
          
          **Differentiation** – Nobody wants their brand to blend into the background. Knowing how you stand out from competitors will help you establish your unique selling point. Figure out how to convince audiences to buy into your brand over your rivals by assessing competitors, the industry itself and, most important of all, your own strengths as a business.
          
          A successful recipe takes plenty of refinement, but get things right and your brand will most definitely provide food for thought.
