introduction: |
  The ability to think outside the box can be second nature to some creatives, but how easy is it to train your brain. To think unfiltered, unboxed and unbiased is a skill the best creative thinkers hold, but with these few exercises you too could become the next great thinker in your team.

          e.g *Think Creative – aceehiiknrttv *Blackpool – abckloop

          Previously we set the challenge of connecting 9 dots with 4 straight lines without lifting your pen from the paper, you can find the challenge in our blog post [Thinking outside the box!](/thinking/thinking-outside-the-box/) or on our social media accounts with the solution.
          
          These creative warm ups allow your thoughts to be responsive whilst attaining a deeper understanding surrounding your concepts. Richard W. Paul, a leading expert on critical thinking theory and author of critical thinking says, “Critical thinking is thinking about your thinking while you’re thinking in order to make your thinking better.” Approach your ideas and concepts with the same open and playful manner to these challenges.
