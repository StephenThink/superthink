          Everyone knows how awkward arranging a Secret Santa can be. Whether it’s tiresomely trying to gather everyone together for the name drawing ceremony, having to go back and repick names because someone’s drawn themself, or even mass confusion over details like deadlines and drop-off points, things never seem to go very smoothly – until now.
          
          That’s right: our free, straightforward, superfast Secret Santa Generator is here. We’ve got creative with the format so that you can focus on getting creative with gift ideas (and wrapping paper, of course).
          
          It’s as simple as entering the name and email of each participant (not to mention a suitably inventive group title). Finer details such as price limit, deadline and drop-off point can also be specified. Those taking part will immediately receive an email containing the name of their chosen giftee. What’s not to like?
          
          Whether you are co-workers, family or friends, make this year’s Secret Santa completely hassle-free. From all of us at Think!Creative, wishing you a very merry Christmas.
