    noun: Define
    text: 'It’s hard to know where you’re going without a map. Our mapping process is a series of exercises and workshops designed to uncover exactly what’s going on. We''ll ask you lots of questions, talk to your customers and develop a map of the market. We''ll look at the trends and the basic principles of great creative work. Together, we can build a picture of where you''re competing before we work out how to compete.'

    noun: Plan
    text: 'In an ideal world you''d have unlimited budget. But in the real world you have to make choices about what you will (and won''t) spend your hard earned budget on. If mapping shows you the territory, now you can work out what you''re going to do with it. Where will you play? Who will you target and who will you ignore? What will you say? This is where we''ll help you plan the next steps. Through strategies, briefing and frameworks, we''ll link your commercial needs with creative opportunity. That way you get work that both looks the business and does the business.'
