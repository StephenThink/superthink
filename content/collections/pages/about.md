    title: 'Step 1'
    noun: Define
    text: 'It’s hard to know where you’re going without a map. Our mapping process is a series of exercises and workshops designed to uncover exactly what’s going on. We''ll ask you lots of questions, talk to your customers and develop a map of the market. We''ll look at the trends and the basic principles of great creative work. Together, we can build a picture of where you''re competing before we work out how to compete.'

    noun: Plan
    text: 'In an ideal world you''d have unlimited budget. But in the real world you have to make choices about what you will (and won''t) spend your hard earned budget on. If mapping shows you the territory, now you can work out what you''re going to do with it. Where will you play? Who will you target and who will you ignore? What will you say? This is where we''ll help you plan the next steps. Through strategies, briefing and frameworks, we''ll link your commercial needs with creative opportunity. That way you get work that both looks the business and does the business.'

      The team at Think! are nimble, smart and professional. Their style is collaborative, we can pose an open
      design problem or a half developed concept and either way they surprise us with the creativity of the
      solution. They are efficient and timely turning work around and communicative in managing expectations,
      always delivering against our deadlines and budgets. Most importantly though, they partner with us to
      understand our needs and create customer centric, creative solutions valued by our users.

      We have worked with Think!Creative for a number of years. They are a team of highly-talented, creative
      professionals, but what we really value about them, is that they know the importance of strategic and
      business goals. We cannot emphasise enough the variety in projects we have asked for their support on
      over the years, and they deliver compelling creative solutions each time. They are our go-to supplier, we
      can trust them, and they deliver outstanding, quality work. Highly recommend.

      From the first time we met Think! to discuss and outline future marketing initiatives, it was clear that
      they grasped what was being expected from them. Think!Creative came into their own and the results
      showed immediately in our order book. In a market where it is impossible to achieve a like for like price, we know that we received excellent value for money.
