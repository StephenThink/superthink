          Payments may be made by online transfer, cash or cheque. Publication and/or release of work done by Think!Creative on behalf of the client, may not take place before cleared funds have been received.

          Returned cheques will incur an additional fee of £50 per returned cheque. Think!Creative reserves the right to consider an account to be in default in the event of a returned cheque.
