title: 'Stats Made Simple'
overriding_introduction: '<p>You could write a string of stats until you feel you’ve proved your point. But the danger with lots of bullet points is that only the first couple will ever make their mark. So when you have a lot of informational snippets to get across and need a compelling way of doing it, choose an infographic. Our North West infographic illustrators know how to turn dry data into a powerful case.</p>'
