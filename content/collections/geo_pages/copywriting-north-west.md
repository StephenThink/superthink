  ## COPYWRITING FOR THE WEB

  Concise. Clear. To the point. The information your customers need, delivered simply. Like this.


  ## COPY FOR COMPANY MATERIAL

  There are rules for every channel via which you wish your company’s message to be displayed. If it’s a poster headline you’ll need no more than 14 words. For Twitter, it’s just 140 characters. Web content only needs a few words and so SEO needs to say a lot in bitesize chunks. Find out how our North West copywriters to they can get your messaging working for you.


  ## NEW LIFE FOR OLD WORDS

  Saying something new to breathe new life into old messages (while keeping to brand guidelines) isn’t easy. These are the challenges our North West copywriters love. They are always looking to say something new while keeping a company message on brand and focused on the goal.
