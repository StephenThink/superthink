title: 'Choising the Right Web Development'
overriding_introduction: '<p>&ldquo;We need a new website.&rdquo; For so many people, it&rsquo;s the first reaction to changes in technology. Site not optimisable? You need a new website. Not mobile friendly? Looks a little out of date? You need a new website.</p><p>Many Blackpool web development companies will simply crack on and build you a new website. But what if there are others simpler, cheaper alternatives?</p>'

  ## WEB DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT THE PAIN
  
  Web development for your Blackpool business shouldn’t leave you tearing your hair out. It should hit the agreed deadlines, meet the budget, and do all the things you were promised.
  
  Web development should also give your business a new lease of life, enabling it to harness the latest technologies and make your job simpler, faster or more cost-effective. We’ll make sure yours does.
  
  
  ## EVERY I DOTTED. EVERY T CROSSED
  
  There’s more to web development in Blackpool than simply creating a website that looks great and is simple and intuitive to navigate. Where are the images coming from? Who’s writing the words? Who’s managing the hosting? When you’re not sure of the answers, we’ve got the complete web development team to ensure every part of your site gets the attention it needs.
  
  
  ## THE RIGHT BLACKPOOL WEB CONSULTANT
  
  There are a lot of web developers in Blackpool. There are far fewer web consultants. That’s telling, because the strategy behind your website is every bit as important as the technical ability to create it.
  
  That’s why, at Think!Creative, we do both, so the website you end up with is exactly the website you need.
  
  
  ## THE WEBSITE YOU REALLY NEED
  
  Before we set to work on web development, first we take the time to find out what it is you want your website to do that it doesn’t do currently. Only then can we know if you really need a new website, or whether, with a plug-in or two or a new skin over your existing site’s back end, the site you have could do the job perfectly well.
