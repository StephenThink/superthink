  ## A CHANGE IS AS GOOD AS A REST

  When it comes to branding in Blackpool, our experts have found that a few small, occasional changes can breathe new life in to what feels like a tired brand. That means working with someone who not only knows how to build a brand from the ground up, but also how to take what’s great about an existing brand and make it refresh better.
