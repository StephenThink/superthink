overriding_introduction: '<p>The conventional thought is that images are only used to break up blocks of text or fill up space. This no longer is true.

  ## SIMPLE BUT DETAILED
  
  Stats are so powerful as a way of getting information across to the reader. The problem is when too many stats hit the reader they can become overwhelmed and the information losses its power. This is where infographics come in. They can help you explain large amounts of information and still keep the reader interested. It’s the mix of information and imagery that increases the chances of the reader understanding and retaining the information. For infographic and other forms of data illustration in Preston, talk to us.
