overriding_introduction: '<p>We keep getting told that print is dead and that digital is the way to reach the largest audience, but is this true? Here at Think!Creative’s Lancashire print design studio we think print is far from dead. “You can’t beat an old book.” This is because the reader can touch and smell the pages. These tactile responses are the reason why print is still hugely important when developing company material.</p>'

  ## YOUR COMPANY’S FOOTPRINT

  Your Lancashire company needs printed material. Who is the audience? How big is the target market? What’s the goal? And what form of print will meet those goals best? Just as important are questions of branding, tone of voice, message and impact. Creating quality print material requires addressing all of the above – and more. And at Think!Creative, our Lancashire print designers have years of experience creating the perfect blend.


  ## BEEN THERE, DONE IT!

  We have worked on print projects for over a decade for lots of businesses across Lancashire, creating print material for companies as large as BP and BAE Systems.
