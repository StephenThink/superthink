mini_introduction: 'Promotional events are the lifeblood of a brand with as many products as Michelin. To make a point, you''ve got to get your message across in a very real way. That''s why Michelin asked us to help them with an event where the CrossClimate2 tyre would be demonstrated to dealers on track.'
