          Newsletters are important communication tools between the company and its employees. But let's be honest, they can be a bit dull can't they? Not the best start when you've got important information to get across. BP came to us because they needed their newsletter to deliver material and insights through interviews, training programme updates and support.

          We designed an engaging, interactive newsletter that encourages employees to feel more connected to the company and their work. Along with key topics of interest for staff, we also included visual representations of data via infographics, videos and audio soundbites to help get BP's message across in a simple but effective way.
