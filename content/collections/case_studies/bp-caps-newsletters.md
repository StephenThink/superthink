        intro: 'Newsletters are important communication tools between the company and its employees. BP CAPs interactive pdfs deliver material and insights through interviews, training programme updates and support. Outlining topics of discussion amongst staff, allowing easy navigation and interactivity enable employees to feel connected to the company and their work. Visual representations of data and information presented through infographics and embedding media such as videos and sound bites aid in readers retaining the information effectively.'
