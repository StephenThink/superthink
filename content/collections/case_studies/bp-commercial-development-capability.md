        intro: |
          Interactive PDFs have a lot going for them: they’re engaging, paper-saving, intuitive and especially great for employee training material. Maybe that's why our long-term clients BP came to us to create a 72-page PDF detailing their Career Development Framework. 

          Our goal was to simplify streams of information into a digestible and visually-appealing format for their commercial team. We worked closely with BP every step of the way. The result? A creative design that perfectly captures how important developing their staff is to the brand’s future growth.
