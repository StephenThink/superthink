          Scary. Fun. Not 2 things you normally put in the same sentence. But that's exactly what our friends at Merlin Entertainments needed from us. Their launch of the new Blackpool Tower Dungeons was a big deal. And so they wanted to make a big noise about it. 

          We created an integrated concept called "survive the fun" that ran across multiple media. From bus-shells to leaflets, from websites to landing pages, we covered it all. A campaign designed to appeal to families who want a fun and scary experience? Job done.
