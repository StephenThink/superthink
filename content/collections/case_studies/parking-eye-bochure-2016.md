        intro: 'ParkingEye are a market leading technology-led car park management company, and they required some promotional material to showcase that to potential customers. With a little creative magic, we have taken their tech heavy content and uninspiring software screenshots (car park management, it isn’t pretty) and produced an elongated trifold brochure that anybody can simply pick up, browse and effortlessly retain the information in a concise and manageable way. Our mission was to make their content communicate with the audience effectively. Mission complete we’d say.'
