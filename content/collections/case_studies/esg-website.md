        intro: 'We''d already designed and developed a revitalised online presence for Utiligroup. However, things change in business. With a new vision for the future and a complete rebrand to ESG Global, we had to take things up a notch to build brand spanking new responsive websites in both English and Japanese, that were future-proof and ready to give people a brilliant online experience. We needed to shout from the server racks that they''re an industry leading global software provider with a technical but exciting approach to what they do. We pushed the design and the story with a combination of fluid layered pages built up with energetic motion graphics. The result? Increased unique users year on year and a more effective web experience all round.'
