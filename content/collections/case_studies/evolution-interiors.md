          There’s nothing we like more than when a business moves into a brand-spanking new office and enlists our help in adding a splash of branding to the walls. For long-term clients Evolution, we looked to make use of the sweeping blue and green logo elements, which we felt really showed off the versatility of the brand.
          We created glass manifestations, entrance signage, interior wall graphics and a meeting room table-top design, with each solution based around the concept of development, progression and moving forward. That’s Evolution.
