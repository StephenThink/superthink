        intro: 'It was a project that spanned all our skillsets, from scriptwriting to character design and illustration, to animation, editing and sound. The resulting explainer video gives employees the knowledge to enhance their work life experience, and the tools to ensure the company knows how to attract, retain, engage and motivate its people. By creating a story around the EVP, we were able to ‘show not tell’ its details and benefits, creating an engaging experience that injects charm and warmth into the BAE Systems brand. '
