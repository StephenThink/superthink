        intro: |-
          In every business, employer and employee are part of a deal – with a shared understanding of the things expected from both parties. But how often do we actually articulate that relationship? And if you do articulate it, how do you do it in a way that makes people sit up and listen? That was our challenge. Create a video that told the story of BAE Systems’ Employee Value Proposition (EVP) in the most ‘full service’ of ways.
          It was a collaborative project that spanned all our skillsets, from scriptwriting, character design and illustration, to animation, editing and sound.

        intro: 'The resulting explainer video gives employees the knowledge to enhance their work life experience, and the tools to ensure the company knows how to attract, retain, engage and motivate its people. By creating a story around the EVP, we were able to ‘show not tell’ its details and benefits, creating an engaging experience that injects charm and warmth into the BAE Systems brand.'
