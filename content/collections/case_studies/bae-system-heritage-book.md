        intro: '180 pages of beautiful print. As society rapidly becomes digitised, itâ€™s nice to sometimes still hold something with substance in your hand. BAE Systems created an extensive word-processed document covering the 167 year history of the Tank Factory, but heritage like this deserves an appropriate platform. Clean layouts, manageable blocks of text, creative typography considerations and a consistent approach throughout gives this publication both style and substance. Whether you read a little or you read a lot, it should always be a pleasurable experience.'
