        intro: 'Ignition RM offer Fleet Risk Management to clients across the UK, and in need of a strong brand presence in the market, they appreciate that this needs a creative-led approach. The outcome is an iconic mark with a vision for movement, along with strong messaging and an unusual approach to promotional material. Who wouldn’t pay attention when a beautifully silk screened parking ticket lands on their door mat? Who wouldn’t plug in when a company specialising in transport management offers you a USB ‘Key’? It just goes to show that a creative-led approach to your business’ brand can really set you apart from the competition. Your brand is the most precious thing you have – invest in it.'
