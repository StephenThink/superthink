        intro: 'When dealing with large amounts of statistical data, it is important to present information in a way that people can break down easily. The BAE Gender Report required us to translate heavy streams of data via creative infographics, charts and tables, all designed with the aim of helping audiences to easily interpret the relevant information. The report’s infographics and charts retain BAE Systems’ branding, resulting in a consistent, engaging outcome which continuously highlights the value that BAE Systems places on equal opportunities.'
