          If you're not careful, your message can easily get lost in translation. That's doubly true when your message is based on hefty reports and analytical data. But that's exactly the challenge BAE Systems came to us with. Their yearly gender report is designed to help employees understand their progress towards gender equality.

          We helped them through that challenge by designing a report featuring creative infographics, charts and tables. The visuals both retain BAE Systemsâ€™ branding and bring the data to life. This not only makes for an engaging read, but it also highlights the value that BAE Systems puts on promoting equal opportunities.
