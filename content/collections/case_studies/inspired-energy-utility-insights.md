        intro: 'The Inspired Energy Utility Insights project presented the team with an exciting branding exercise. Outcomes included printed concertina booklets, pull-up banners, digital email campaigns and a website including members-only access. These were a culmination of time spent on the drawing board developing a sub-brand as compelling as its parent. Designed to attract audiences to Inspired Energy’s series of nationwide forums, webinars and podcasts, each deliverable features eye-catching graphics. Dynamic, abstract waves act as the lead visuals, contrasting strongly against Inspired’s Midnight Blue to depict a highly-energised and captivating brand. The VIP client portal differentiates itself through the use of an alternative but no less impactful colour palette.'
