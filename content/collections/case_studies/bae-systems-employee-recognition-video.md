          BAE Systems asked us to use the EVP characters we created to develop a brand new employee recognition video. The goal of this was to show how managers can make a noise about people on their team and their contribution to BAE Systems.

          The result? BAE Systems bringing out the best in their staff brought the best out in us too. Managers got a timely reminder of just how important it is to recognise the efforts of others. And we used conceptual thinking, copywriting, storyboarding, illustration and motion graphics to create an engaging and impactful video. A nice little bit of teamwork we'd say.
