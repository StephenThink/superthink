        intro: 'When it comes to illustration and animation, the only limit is imagination. The BAE Employee Recognition Video required us to develop an engaging and impactful outcome which highlighted the importance of recognising peopleâ€™s efforts within the business, with the ultimate aim of bringing out the best in everyone. Through utilising the EVP characters, we were able to develop an impactful, immersive story which highlighted how managers can show others that their contribution is important to BAE Systems. The process required a multi-disciplinary approach which consisted of conceptual thinking, copywriting, storyboarding, illustration and motion graphics.'
