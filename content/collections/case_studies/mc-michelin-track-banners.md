        intro: 'We went back to basics for this one. We come up with a skid pan graphic that updated the old CGI Michelin Man to his modern look and feel. Combined with the brand colour palette and some creatively placed chevrons - we had something our drivers literally couldn''t miss in their wet weather session. That graphic is was complemented with alternating track side banners that put the Michelin brand front and centre at the Porsche Driving Experience Centre at Silverstone.'
