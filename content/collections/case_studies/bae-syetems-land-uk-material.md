        intro: 'BAE Systems Land (UK) needed their brochures and folders bringing on-brand, and with clear messaging, clean layouts and images with serious impact, we have delivered exactly that. The rebrand is really taking shape, and as one of only a few agencies selected by BAE Systems to continue as an ‘Agency of Choice’, we’re really enjoying working with it, pushing those boundaries whenever we’re given the chance.'
