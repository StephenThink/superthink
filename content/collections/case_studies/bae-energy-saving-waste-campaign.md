        intro: 'A poster campaign to highlight to BAE Systems employees the amount of wasted energy the business goes through during the Easter holiday period. To connect with a large audience, we have taken a tongue-in-cheek approach with some creative copywriting to deliver the financial figures to people in a way we can all relate, and after a successful reaction to the campaign, a similar approach has been taken for a Christmas campaign. An important message delivered in a fun way to great effect.'
