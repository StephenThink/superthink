        intro: 'Utiligroup were looking for a newsletter that was fun yet informative, for both their clients and their employees. A sporty approach was desired, to coincide with a sporting event taking place at the time of publication, and so ‘SwitchedOn’ was born. Although the news they are delivering is serious, they wanted the delivery of it to be a little more light-hearted, and the range of newsletters have proved successful at achieving that.'
