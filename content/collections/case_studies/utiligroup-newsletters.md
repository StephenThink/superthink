        intro: 'Utiligroup were looking for a newsletter that was fun and informative for both their clients and their employees. They wanted a different approach to tie in with a sporting event around the time the newsletter was due to come out. And so ‘SwitchedOn’ was born. Although the news is serious, they wanted the delivery of that news to be a bit more light-hearted, and our range of newsletters have done just that.'
