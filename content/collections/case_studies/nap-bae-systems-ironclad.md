        intro: 'To boldly go… BAE Systems’ Ironclad is a small, unmanned ground vehicle designed to undertake those dangerous tasks that would endanger soldiers’ lives. So when BAE Systems approached us ahead of the 2017 Defence and Security Equipment International Conference in London to produce the supporting materials, we jumped at the chance. From illustrated technical drawings and photo-real visuals, to posters showcasing the extraordinary multi-role potential of Ironclad, we worked hard with BAE within a tight timescale to deliver in time for the launch.'
