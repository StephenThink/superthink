        intro: 'Exhibited at 2017’s Defence and Security Equipment International conference in London, BAE Systems’ Ironclad is a small unmanned ground vehicle designed to take on dangerous jobs that soldiers would normally face. We were delighted to produce a series of illustrated technical drawings and posters which showcased the extraordinary potential that Ironclad possesses. The technical drawings were an extremely effective way of visualising Ironclad’s adaptability, whilst the copy content of our posters successfully communicated the stats behind the impressive machine.
