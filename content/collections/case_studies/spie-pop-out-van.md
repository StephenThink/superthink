          SPIE came to us with a simple message to get over to their customers. The challenge? Make that message unforgettable. We had to come up with an idea that would stick around on people's desks and in their minds. In short, we had to create the sort of thing you can't ignore. So that's why we came up with an idea and a format that completely broke the mould. Our bespoke 3D pop up van got their message across in a big way. 

          Who said that pop ups are just for kids? Not us, that's for sure. And we're glad SPIE agreed.
