        intro: 'SPIE had a simple message they wanted to relay to their customers, and they wanted it to be unforgettable. So we needed something that would remain on people’s desks, forever on the mind, and something that people just couldn’t ignore.'

        intro: 'Our approach involved designing a bespoke template based on their fleet of vans, to be popped out and built effortlessly into a fun 3D reminder that you can’t help but love – everyone’s inner child will come out to play when one of these lands on their desk. We’ve definitely still got ours.'
