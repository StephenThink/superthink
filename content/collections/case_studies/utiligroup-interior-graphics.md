          When Utiligroup asked us to design a series of wall wraps for their meeting rooms, we created a concept inspired by technology and forward thinking. Utiligroup liked the idea so much that they named the three meeting rooms Cloud, Computer and Internet. 

          We were also commissioned to produce a wrap for the entrance to the Utiligroup premises, which gave us us the chance to create an impactful and memorable welcome wall. For this design, we used a mix of contemporary fonts and bold, captivating colours - all of which are a true reflection of Utiligroupâ€™s bold brand identity.
