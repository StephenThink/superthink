        intro: 'ParkingEye’s brand and supporting material was very authoritative, portrayed through its strong use of a black and yellow colour palette, angular chevron graphics and strong messaging. This is no longer the brand perception they want; it no longer represents their brand values. So we have crafted their brand based around a creative strategy to re-establish them as a company they are – on they efficiently manages carparks, to the benefit of both the owner and their customers.

        intro: 'This has been done by softening the brand – a fresher colour palette that utilises white space well, a softer typeface, a new tone of voice for all messaging that talks to the audience, not at them, easy-on-the-eye graphics that appear less authoritative and supporting imagery that suggests an overseeing approach rather than an enforcing one. Along with considerations to layout formats and print finishes, the evolution of ParkingEye’s brand has proved a great success for a company that understands the importance of brand perception.'
