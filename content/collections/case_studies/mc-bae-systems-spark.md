mini_introduction: 'One of our key roles as a selected agency partner for BAE Systems is to look after their brand - and that includes how to creatively develop sub-brands. So when BAE Systems launched a new learning platform in 2021, we needed to work our magic on this dazzling new sub-brand.'

It''s an online, on-demand platform that allows staff to build learning into their daily workflows. A platform like that deserves a top class identity.

        intro: 'We began by crafting a logo that would sit neatly as part of their sub-brand identity system, while also including an identifier of its own. Our approach here was to develop a branded word mark, that features asterisk iconography built into the word. We then twinned that with a nodes visual to let the visual and key messaging hang together. The concept behind this was to highlight the connections between staff that build up the knowledge in the company over time.'
