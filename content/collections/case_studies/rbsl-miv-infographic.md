        intro: 'RBSL’s impressive Boxer vehicle has been touted as a solution to the UK MOD’s Mechanised Infantry Vehicle (MIV) programme. To demonstrate the suitability of Boxer and illustrate how RBSL could contribute to the UK’s prosperity agenda, our team created a printed solution which condensed a complex and ambitious plan into an impactful and easy-to-process infographic. As we continue to apply the brand’s visual identity to new creative projects, it’s so rewarding to witness RBSL grow in consistency and integrity – long may our partnership continue.'
