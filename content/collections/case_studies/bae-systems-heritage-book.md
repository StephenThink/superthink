        intro: 'When you''re dealing with a story stretching back 167 years, a 4 inch screen just won''t cut it. So when BAE Systems came to us for an idea to celebrate the history of The Tank Factory, we strongly recommended that they do it in print. Using archive photography, we crafted an editorial design that balances a clean and modern layout with the historical character of the photos. We also included colourful bars set off against bold typography and callouts to take readers on a journey into the hidden story of the factory. '
