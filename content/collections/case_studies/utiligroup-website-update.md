        intro: 'We''d already designed and developed a revitalised online presence for Utiligroup. With a brand spanking new responsive website, the brand was future-proof and ready to give people a brilliant online experience. But things change in business. With a new vision for the future, Utiligroup wanted us to take things up a notch and build on that fabulous foundation. We needed to shout from the server racks that they''re an industry leading software provider with a technical but exciting approach to what they do. So that''s why we pushed the design and the story even further, with a combination of fluid layered pages built up with energetic motion graphics. The result? Increased unique users year on year and a more effective web experience all round.  '
