        intro: 'We have already designed and developed a fully responsive website for Utiligroup. One that functions beautifully across desktop, tablet and mobile devices; user experience really is key these days. With a new vision for the business, Utiligroup wanted to take the site in a slightly new direction, so once the creative strategy was in place, we began work on making sure that anyone visiting their website could instantly see they are an industry leading software provider with a technical but exciting approach to what they do. A combination of fluid layered pages built up with strong graphical content and energetic motion graphics has helped deliver the website Utiligroup desire.'
