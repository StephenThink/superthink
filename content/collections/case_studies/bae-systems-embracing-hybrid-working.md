        intro: 'This is where the conversation started with BAE Systems on the brief to produce a suite of supporting documents to help staff and managers work through the practicalities. We created a friendly and engaging look for the project to give the documents an instantly recognisable identity, whilst steering clear of looking like typical policy books. We then produced these as interactive PDFs to fully support people working remotely. Just the job!'
