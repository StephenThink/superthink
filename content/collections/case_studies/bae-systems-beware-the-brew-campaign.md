        intro: 'Brief: a poster to warn employees of the risks involved when making a brew in the workplace. Something that people will pay attention to, not ignore and forget about. Hold on, we can have some real fun with this and create a campaign that will really get noticed. A campaign that will be talked about, one that will last. And so ‘Beware of the Brew’ was born. With its mischievous monster face and devilish personality staring at employees from strategically positioned posters and the very cups they brew up in, it’s hard not to talk about it. Message heard loud and clear, so we’re told.'
