        intro: 'How do you get a serious message across? Conventional wisdom says that your message should also be serious. Right? Actually, erm... no. If you want to get attention, you have to pay attention to what people pay attention to, if you catch our drift. That''s usually not boring information, as you''ll know from the last time you ignored the safety demonstration on a plane.'

        intro: 'So when BAE Systems asked us to develop a campaign to remind people of the dangers in a hot drink, we knew exactly what to do. With its mischievous face and devilish personality staring back at employees ‘Beware of the Brew’ was the perfect way to get our message noticed and talked about.'
