        intro: 'Spinal Products specialise in devices that support your spine and help you to ‘love your back’. When when you''re asking people to trust their body to a brand, it has to inspire complete confidence. So that''s why we helped them develop a strong brand presence and functional e-commerce website. The strong image supports a simple and effective online buying experience (with style of course.) Overall, we''ve been able to help Spinal Products make their mark - and to stand tall above the competition.'
