        intro: 'Spinal Products are a company that specialise in devices that support your spine and help you to ‘love your back’. They needed a strong brand presence and functional e-commerce website to really make their mark in the industry by offering their customers a simple and effective purchasing experience with style, and they needed a brand that people would trust their bodies to. We’ve given them exactly that, helping them stand tall amongst the competition.'
