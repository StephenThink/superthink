        intro: 'PIC are a property investment company with a difference, who required a brand that both expressed their values whilst looking nothing like your traditional finance company. After all, traditional they are not. The selected wordmark and structured graphic uses a geometric triangular grid to reinforce strength and reliability, whilst symbolising cubic space and area. Angled elements on the wordmark subtly depict a forward thinking direction. Thatâ€™s forward thinking direction for a forward thinking company. Creative stationery and a fully responsive website with personality soon followed, giving PIC the brand perception they so rightly desired.'
