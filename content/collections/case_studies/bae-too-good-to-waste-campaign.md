        intro: 'Training in a Box â€“ a suite of materials to empower BAE Systems managers to educate their employees on environmental awareness. An iconic approach has been taken with this to give the programme ownership and to break the content down into five clear sections, keeping the delivery of information manageable. A square format booklet, work sheets, training resources and lanyard reminders have been created, along with the case itself to give them a one-stop resource for all material offering an effective delivery of the message.'
