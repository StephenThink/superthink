        intro: |-
          You already know knowledge is power. But shared knowledge is dynamite. And that's doubly true when it comes to understanding what we can do to improve our impact on environment. That's why BAE Systems came to us to help them share what they're doing to reduce their environmental impact.
          Our response? An engaging box, designed to break everything down into engaging and manageable chunks.
