          Strategy reports are changing. Employees demand they can access the report when it works for them, and they definitely don't want to be trudging through a dull slab of print. BAE Systems asked us to tackle that challenge by creating a hybrid digital & print report that would inspire employees to contribute to their own future success.

          To inspire you have to focus on the engagement factor. That's why we produced not just a printed booklet with a digital version but also an interactive PDF. The interactive PDF is engaging and user-friendly. And it also effectively communicates how BAE Systems and its employees share a commitment towards personal improvement.
