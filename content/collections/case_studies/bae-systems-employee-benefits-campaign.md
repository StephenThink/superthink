        intro: 'A mailer with serious doormat appeal that will excite the audience (BAE Systems employees and their families) and deliver a message that will drive traffic to sign-up to an employee benefit scheme online. After careful consideration to the format, layout, messaging, imagery/graphics and appeasing the Royal Mailâ€™s strict guidelines, 34,000 mailers have been designed, printed with personalisation and mailed around the world, and the whole process has been organised by the team at Think!Creative. A range of posters and e-cards have also been created to strengthen the message.'
