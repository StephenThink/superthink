        intro: 'Trust. It''s easy to talk about but hard to get. And it''s something we definitely have from our friends at BAE Systems. We''ve been overseeing the management and design of Pensions Booklets for thousands of BAE Systems’ retired pension scheme members for years now. We work to a strict schedule to deliver over 200,000 copies of informative newsletters, some of which travel all around the world. A chunk of work goes into making each one – and we love the scale of the project and the responsibility that comes with it.'
