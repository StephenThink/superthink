        intro: 'We are proud to design and oversee the mailing of Pensions Booklets to thousands of BAE Systems’ retired pension scheme members. We work to a strict schedule to produce approximately 200,000 copies of various informative newsletters, some of which travel overseas. A great deal of work goes into producing each outcome – we relish the scale of the project and the responsibility that comes with it.'
