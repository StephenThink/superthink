        intro: 'Supporting BAE Systems with a range of informative campaign posters encouraging employees to recycle more of their waste. We created multiple posters and printed banners to be seen across all of their sites and different sectors of the business, from Land, Sea, and Air to Submarine with focused statistics for each department. When asking employees to carry out tasks, itâ€™s important to make it as fun as possible. With posters near to recycling bins posing questions for the audience to vote via their trash creates an engagement between the campaign and employees whilst also recycling!'
