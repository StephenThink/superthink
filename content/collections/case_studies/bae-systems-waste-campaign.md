        intro: 'The world is in a battle with waste. So much of what we use could have a new life, if only we knew where to put it. And you know what? People do recycle - but sometimes they need a little jolt to do it. That''s why we created a campaign to transform the habits of different sectors of BAE Systems - from Land, Sea, and Air to Submarine. To do this, we put recycling bins in the spotlight by using space in carefully selected locations to highlight our campaign posters.'

        intro: 'The design features graphics that show what recycling can do, along with a teaser message and gentle encouragement for staff to vote with their trash. And that''s exactly what they did. BAE tell us that they''ve seen significantly higher rates of recycling than in past years. '
