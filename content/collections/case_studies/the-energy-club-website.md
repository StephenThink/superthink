        intro: 'If you’re looking to drive online audiences towards a specific product or service, a landing page could be just the ticket. Inspired Energy’s sub-brand, The Energy Club, approached us to develop a page which promoted the company’s mobile app, through which business owners can track and manage their energy usage. Against the backdrop of Inspired’s midnight blue, the punchy gradient really sets The Energy Club’s branding apart, helped in no small part by the animated header, an additional suggestion which our team felt really brought the design to life.
