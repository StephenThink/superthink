        intro: 'If you’re looking to drive online audiences towards a specific product or service, a landing page is just the ticket. Inspired Energy’s sub-brand, The Energy Club, approached us to develop a page to promote their mobile app, where business owners can track and manage their energy use. Against the backdrop of Inspired’s midnight blue, the punchy gradient really sets The Energy Club’s branding apart. But what really brings this one to life is the animated header, which is the kind of unexpected extras you can expect us to suggest when you work with us.'
