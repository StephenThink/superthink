        intro: 'Michelin challenged us to help them launch their brand new CrossClimate2 tyre in late 2021. Working in partnership with a media agency, we helped them create and deliver a fully integrated campaign. To demonstrate the flexibility of the CrossClimate2 across the seasons, we built a campaign that worked across print and digital work - into outdoor, radio, social media and more. We were also tasked with getting radio and TV clearance for the client on those creative outputs.'

        intro: 'Building on the key message of "Master the Unpredictable," we started with the backbone of any solid marketing campaign - animated assets for social media and online display advertising. Next, we built on that with a co-branded campaign with Kwik Fit. This included a co-branded TV campaign and social assets. Finally we led on the direction of the accompanying radio ad, working with Lydia Rose Bewley as the voice of Michelin and Olivia Sweeney as a Brit frustrated with our ever-changing weather. '

        intro: 'Last, but definitely not least, we shifted our aim outside. Literally. We created outdoor advertising for on busses and bus shelters. Creating a series of images based on different weather conditions, we showed the dexterity of the CrossClimate2 in its element, powering through the sleet and rain that we get here in the UK. Oh, and we did all that with customised messaging for different stages of the customer journey too.'
