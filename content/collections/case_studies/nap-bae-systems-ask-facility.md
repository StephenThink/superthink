        intro: 'After working with BAE Systems for over a decade, providing them creative support is something that comes naturally to us. However knowing a brand inside-out doesn’t make each new project any less exciting - quite the opposite. When we were approached to produce a range of material for the company’s Academy for Skills & Knowledge (ASK), a cutting-edge learning experience based at Samlesbury Aerospace Enterprise Zone, we were more than happy to take on the creative challenge.

        intro: 'High-tech training facilities should be all about memorable experiences. Combining the power of video with the striking printed collateral and head-turning large-scale graphics defined our approach to the brief from the start, to capture the essence and excitement of technology-led learning.'

        intro: 'Nothing makes an impression quite like large-format display graphics. Inspirational quotes, eye-catching illustrations and way-finding signage transform windows and walls into head-turning attractions. Developing its own distinctive sub-brand identity became core to the brief, which we carried across internal and external graphics, digital and physical signage, printed material and innovative gifts for executive international guests. From core values to brand guidelines, BAE Systems trust us to always protect and develop their brand, through any scale of project.'
