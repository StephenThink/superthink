          The CAPs programme is a premier online education platform at BP. The platform gives BP employees easy access to course, training information and additional tools. So when BP came to us to create a digital interface and print design, we focussed on creating a user experience with easy navigation. The clean layout is designed to help people through their development and learning journey.

          BP tell us the thing they like about the platform is how quickly staff can find and use the content. We're taking that as a compliment. Our suggestions of visually presented infographics, calendar overviews and timelines have made the platform a go-to resource for anyone looking to develop their skills.
