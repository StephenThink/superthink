  about_us: |
    Hey up we’re **Think!Creative**. We’re a full-service creative agency founded in 2006. Our award-winning team of creatives, strategists, developers, animators and illustrators come from all parts of the creative industry, which means we see things differently. But creativity isn’t just in our name - it’s what we do for our clients every day. 
    
    Our clients trust us to come up with bold ideas and outstanding design for their brands, so we always have to be on our game. We work with international brands like BAE Systems and BP, alongside ambitious growing brands such as Inspired Energy and Jonesco. We feel right at home whether we’re helping them create, develop or rollout strategies, brand identities and campaigns.
  what_we_are_after: 'We love nothing more than working with curious thinkers and ambitious people who think differently. So although you’re a designer - you’re much more than that. You’ve got the chops to develop, and pitch ideas that make people go “why didn’t we think of that?!” If you’re sick of being a Mac Monkey and want to flex your creative muscles – we’d love to hear from you.'
